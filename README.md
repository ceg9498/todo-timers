## To-do Timers
This project was created to solve a rather specific problem: remembering when certain tasks have been completed last, and knowing if it's time to perform a task again or not.

There is still *much* to do in this project! If you have input, don't hesitate to let me know.

### Origins
This project started as a tool to help me remember tasks specific to Final Fantasy XIV Online, but as I worked on it, I realized that there's so much more it can be used for. As such, I decided to make it more of a general task list.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
